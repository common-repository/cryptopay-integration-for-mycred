### Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway for myCred by CryptoPay

It looks like you're looking for a plugin to accept cryptocurrency payments or pay your users with cryptocurrencies on your WordPress website where you've added gamification with myCred. What if we told you that you've come to the right place?

CryptoPay is a great plugin built entirely for the WordPress ecosystem, allowing you to receive peer-to-peer and commission-free cryptocurrency payments.

This integration plugin allows you to use CryptoPay with myCred and let your users pay you with cryptocurrencies and make deposits with buyCred, as well as make crypto payments to your users with cashCred.
